# GitHub User Search Application

This project is part of my weekly projects at ALX AFRICA. In this week's module I am learning how to work with APIs. The project is built using React (Vite) and integrates with the GitHub API to allow users to search for GitHub profiles.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd alx-fe-reactjs/github-user-search
